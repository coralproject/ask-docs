Some sections are missing/incomplete\n\n\nThe Coral Project is an open source project to help publishers of all sizes build better communities around their journalism. \n\n\nWe believe that if journalism is going to remain relevant and connected to the needs of people who live in a democracy, journalists need to do a better job of listening, validating, factchecking, and responding to experiences, opinions, and ideas. \n\n\nTo do this, we need better tools that make everyone feel safe, respected, and heard. We need to focus our resources on identifying positive contributions as well as making negative ones less prominent.\n\n\nTo achieve these goals, we are:\n\n\n\n\ncreating open source software, and\n\n\ncreating, refining and disseminating practices, tools, and studies \n\n\n\n\nCore code principles\n\n\nIn order to serve communities of varying shapes and sizes, all Coral Project software is conceived from the ground up to be:\n\n\n\n\nConfigurable\n: We strive to use configuration to deliver as much business logic, data modeling, and other aspects of our systems as \nis practical.\n Doing so gives us the ability to quickly configure precise UI experiences, data structures, and data science analysis with minimal need for coding, upgrades, server work, etc. Ultimately, we want the community managers who run our software to feel like they are designing their own house. This means trying things to see how they feel, looking at the results, and quickly making changes based on what they learn. We take our inspiration from the ever-changing, adaptable ecosystems of coral reefs.\n\n\nModular\n: Coral products can be used together to form a fully functioning community platform, or be used in pieces to complement existing software. In order to accomplish this, we are building core API features, message passing and import/export strategies in everything we do. We are also refining, documenting, and publishing deployment strategies for each of our products both in isolation as well as together as groups of our products configured to work in concert.\n\n\nPrivacy Minded\n: There is an implicit act of trust involved in registration for and engagement in an online community. Maintaining that trust is a top priority for us. Privacy for us begins with security concerns, and stretches deep into our product thinking. Whenever information is entered into our systems, we want to make it clear who will be able to see that information and how it will be used. We want to build safe, comfortable places that allow for conversations of varying levels of exposure, without false expectations or nasty surprises.\n\n\nSecure, Stable and Scalable\n: Our deployment recommendations, if followed, provide usable and secure environments. Each piece of our software has internal checks to catch any error states and trigger alarms, as well as external restart mechanisms. All of our platforms have proven records for stability and well-known upgrade paths. We will publish auto-scaling deployment workflows where appropriate for large sites with varying loads.\n\n\n\n\nWhat\ns going on and how can I get involved?\n\n\nWe are still actively developing this open presence and we always looking for \ncontributions\n.

Coral keeps track of the original identifiers (i.e., the user id), and stores that data (using a structure called  ImportSource ) in a field named  Source . That means you won t lose the original identifier data from your original source when you import into Coral.     All import endpoints  upsert  data.

The regular  CRUD  endpoint URL pattern is  /api/* , where as the URL pattern for import endpoints is  /api/import/* .    Import-related endpoints allow you to import data into Coral from an existing source system (i.e., an existing database of comment information).   Coral keeps track of the original identifiers (i.e., the user id), and stores that data (using a structure called  ImportSource ) in a field named  Source . That means you won t lose the original identifier data from your original source when you import into Coral.     All import endpoints  upsert  data. This means that when you import an entry, it will overwrite the information for that entry if the entry already exists. This prevents duplications and other problems.",

This external database is the source of your existing comment data that will be extracted by Sponge and sent to Pillar, which will then load it into the Coral ecosystem.\n\n\nThe external sources we currently support are: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs.\n\n\nVendoring dependencies\n\n\nYou should be vendoring the packages you choose to use. We recommend using \ngovendor\n. This tool will vendor from the vendor folder associated with this project repo for the dependencies in use. It is recommended to use a project based repo with a single vendor folder for all your dependencies.\n\n\nInstall from source\n\n\nBefore you begin\n\n\nIf you want to install from source, you will need to have Go installed.\n\n\nFirst \ninstall Go\n. The \ninstallation and setup instructions\n on the Go website are pretty good. Ensure that you have exported your $GOPATH environment variable, as detailed in the \ninstallation instructions\n.\n\n\nIf you are not on a version of Go that is 1.7 or higher, you will also have to set the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT flag.\n\n\nexport GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not on a version of Go 1.7 or higher, we recommend adding this to your ~/.bash_profile or other startup script.\n\n\nGet the source code\n\n\nYou can install the source code via using the \ngo get\n command, or by manually cloning the code.\n\n\nUsing the go get command\n\n\ngo get github.com/coralproject/sponge\n\n\n\n\nIf you see a message about \nno buildable Go source files\n like the below, you can ignore it.

You can see those example strategy.json files in the \nexamples\n folder: \n$GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/examples\n\n\nTo copy one of the example strategy.json files to another folder, where you can then customize it:\n\n\ncp $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/examples/strategy.json.example $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/strategy/strategy.json\n\n\n\n\nSet your environment variables\n\n\nSetting your environment variables tells sponge which strategy file you want to use, and which \nPillar\n instance you are pushing data into.\n\n\nMake your own copy of the \nconfig/dev.cfg\n file (you can edit this configuration file with your own values, and then ensure that you don\nt commit it back to the repository).

It is the address of the Xenia web service (i.e., an instance of Xenia that you are running on a server).\n\n\nIf you are running everything locally, comment this variable out. This means that the CLI tool will connect directly to your local database, instead of connecting to a running web service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXENIA_HOST\n: default is \n:4000\n if this variable is not set.\n\n\nXENIA_LOGGING_LEVEL\n: default is \n2\n if this variable is not set.\n\n\nXENIA_WEB_AUTH\n: your Anvil token, if you have Anvil authentication set up.

The CLI tool will create collections and sets of indexes that you can use to execute queries: a sort of dictionary of pre-made queries for you to use.\n\n\n1) First cd into cmd/xenia directory (this contains the CLI tool):\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia/cmd/xenia\n\n\n\n\n2) Configure the database using \ndb create\n. The database.json file contains the information necessary to create the collections and indexes.\n\n\n./xenia db create -f scrdb/database.json\n\n\n\n\nExpected output:\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nCreating collection query_sets\nCreating collection query_sets_history\nCreating collection query_scripts\nCreating collection query_scripts_history\nCreating collection query_masks\nCreating collection query_masks_history\nCreating collection query_regexs\nCreating collection query_regexs_history\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting note #1\n: if you get a response that contains \nERROR: Invalid DB provided\n, you may have an incorrectly set environment variable. If you are running everything locally and using a local MongoDB, use \nprintev\n to see if \nXENIA_WEB_HOST\n is set:\n\n\n\n\nprintenv XENIA_WEB_HOST\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a local MongoDB, this should not return a value. If it does return a value, unset the variable using \nunset\n, and then try step 2 again:\n\n\nunset XENIA_WEB_HOST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting note #2\n: instead of the expected output shown above, you may see something like:\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nCreating collection query_sets\nERROR: collection already exists\n\n\n\n\nThat\ns okay! It means that your database is already set up with Xenia. Perhaps you imported data that already had configured collections set up.

The second query is using the  #data  command. The data command has two options. Use can use  #data.*  or  #data.Idx .  Use the  *  operator when you need an array. In this example we need to support an  $in  command:  {\n    name : retrieve_stations ,\n    desc :  Retrieve the list of stations ,\n    type : pipeline ,\n    collection : test_xenia_data ,\n    return :true,\n    commands :[\n      { $match : { station_id  : { $in :  #data.*:list.station_id }}},\n      { $project : { _id : 0,  name : 1}},\n   ]\n}\n\nWe you need an array to be substitued.\nBefore: { field  : { $in :  #data.*:list.station_id }}}\nAfter : { field  : { $in : [ 42021 ]}}\n    dataOp :  * \n    lookup :  list.station_id \n    results: { list : [{ station_id : 42021 }]}  Use the index operator when you need a single value. Specify which document in the array of documents you want to select:  \n{\n    name : retrieve_stations ,\n    desc :  Retrieve the list of stations ,\n    type : pipeline ,\n    collection : test_xenia_data ,\n    return :true,\n    commands :[\n      { $match : { station_id  :  #data.0:list.station_id }},\n      { $project : { _id : 0,  name : 1}},\n   ]\n}\n\nWe you need a single value to be substitued, select an index.\nBefore: { field  :  #data.0:list.station_id }\nAfter : { field  :  42021 }\n    dataOp : 0\n    lookup :  list.station_id \n    results: { list : [{ station_id : 42021 }, { station_id : 23567 }]}  You can also replace field names in the query commands.

The \nMkDocs website\n contains a lot of good information on writing documentation in MkDocs, and there are plenty of decent Markdown cheatsheets floating around, \nlike this one\n.\n\n\nHow the documentation is organized\n\n\nThe documentation is organized into several categories:\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n: This offers a general overview of the Coral Project and its different components.\n\n\nDeveloper Guide\n: This provides information for technical users of the Coral Project. It offers installation instructions for the Coral Ecosystem as a whole, as well as installation instructions for each individual component.\n\n\nUser Guide\n: This provides information for end users (publishers, journalists, moderators, readers) on how to use the features of Coral.

There are sections for the developers (how to work with GitHub, etc.), as well as sections for those who want to contribute to other pieces of the Coral Project (such as the documentation!).\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\nWriting style\n\n\nThe key thing to remember when writing documentation is to be extremely explicit and detailed. Do not assume knowledge!\n\n\nDo not assume knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhenever possible, include an actual instruction.\n\n\nGood:\n\n\nIf there are command line instructions involved, include the precise command line instruction. Instructions that users can copy/paste into the command line are great!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \nexpected results\n wherever possible. If a command line instruction should return a certain result, show that expected result. If there is a URL you can visit to test whether or not something is working, provide that URL as a link.\n\n\nIf there are variables to configure, explicitly state the purpose of the variables. This should be explained in a comment in the configuration file, but you should also provide an explanation in your instructions.\n\n\nDo not merely explain HOW to do something, but also WHY you are doing it in that way. This makes it easier for users to troubleshoot issues.\n\n\n\n\nCommands and code blocks\n\n\n\n\nEnclose commands and code blocks in triple-tick blocks (```). Yes, Markdown supports indentation to delineate code blocks, but the triple-ticks make things more explicit.\n\n\nBe sure you are using universal command line commands, not shortcuts available in some shells!\n\n\nGood: \nmkdir exampledirectory\n\n\nBad: \nmd exampledirectory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird-party components\n\n\nIs there a third-party component the user needs to set up (for instance, MongoDB)?\n\n\n\n\nDon\nt include all setup instructions, but do link to the setup instructions on the website of the third-party app in question.\n\n\nBe sure to detail any specific instructions they will need to integrate this third-party component into the system.\n\n\nCurrently, much of this \nthird party setup\n information resides in the \nDeveloper Setup\n document. This reduces duplication if there is a component that needs to be set up for multiple items.\n\n\n\n\nMarkup specific style\n\n\n\n\nWhen adding headlines and section dividers, keep in mind that H1 (#) and H2 (##) text shows up in the Table of Contents. H3 (###) and below does not.\n\n\nTo avoid making the ToC too cluttered, try to only use H2 (##) for key large sections.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation instructions\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to include \nevery single step\n. Preferably copy paste.\n\n\nWhen working from the command line, include every step in code blocks.\n\n\n\n\nAPI documentation\n\n\nWhen documenting a REST-style API, such as the \nPillar API\n, there are certain pieces of information to include. The \nPillar API documentation\n is a useful template.\n\n\n\n\nCreate an initial table that lists endpoints, which contains:\n\n\nThe endpoint URL.\n\n\nThe HTTP verb for that endpoint (GET, POST).\n\n\nThe basic functionality description for that endpoint. Make this into a targeted link that jumps to the full description for that endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a full description for each endpoint. You can see the \nGet Users\n Pillar endpoint for an example). Each description should include:\n\n\nThe parameters for the endpoint (include the parameter name, whether it is required or optional, the type, and the description).\n\n\nAn example call.\n\n\nThe response for the example call (whether that is a JSON object, or simply a status response).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nHere are some commonly used terms:\n\n\nSoftware specific\n\n\n\n\nCoral\n: Refers to the Coral product, which includes the three components Trust, Ask, and Talk.\n\n\nCoral Project\n: Refers to the project of building and crafting the Coral product.\n\n\nCoral Ecosystem\n: Refers to all of the pieces that make up Coral from a more technical or development perspective: includes all the technical components such as Pillar, Sponge, and Cay.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n: Refers to the technical users of Coral who will be installing Coral and working with the backend.

You can read more about Git on \ntheir website\n.\n\n\nAfter installing Git, the first thing you should do is setup your name and email:\n\n\ngit config --global user.name \nYour Real Name\n\ngit config --global user.email \nyou@email.com\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that user.name should be your real name, not your GitHub username. The email you use in the user.email field will be used to associate your commits with your GitHub account.\n\n\nSetting up local repository\n\n\nFirst, you need to fork the project: navigate to to the repo in GitHub you want to contribute to and press the \nFork\n button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you\nll see a note that it\ns been forked underneath the project name.\n\n\nNow create a local copy of that fork (in this example, the \ndocs\n repository is the one being cloned):\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/coralproject/docs.git\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a new directory \ndocs\n, containing a clone of your forked GitHub repository. Switch to the project\ns new directory:\n\n\ncd docs\n\n\n\n\nYou will now need to setup coralproject/docs as an \nupstream\n remote. This connects your local repository to the original \nupstream\n source repository (essentially, telling Git that the original reference repository is the source of your local forked copy).\n\n\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/coralproject/docs.git\ngit fetch upstream\n\n\n\n\nIt\ns a good idea to regularly pull in changes from \nupstream\n so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. You can find more detailed instructions on \nsyncing a fork from GitHub\n.    \n\n\nWork on an issue\n\n\nWhen working on an issue, create a new branch for the work. Name the branch for the issue you are working on, capitalizing the word \nIssue\n (for example, \nIssue#82\n).\n\n\ngit checkout master\ngit pull upstream master \n git push origin master\ngit checkout -b Issue#82\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does: First, we ensure we\nre on the master branch. Then, the git pull command will sync our local copy with the upstream project and the git push syncs it to our forked GitHub project. Finally, we create our new branch.\n\n\nNow you can start coding! Ensure that you only fix the thing you\nre working on (don\nt get sidetracked into fixing other little things you see along the way).\n\n\nCommitting\n\n\nWhen committing, be sure to commit in logical blocks and add meaningful commit messages.\n\n\ngit commit -m 'Added instructions for commit messages'\n\n\n\n\nSome guidelines to follow:\n\n\n\n\nNever force-push your changes.\n\n\nWrite your commit messages in the past tense, not present tense.\n\n\nGood: \nAdded instructions for commit messages\n\n\nBad: \nAdd instructions for commit messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor commits to a branch, prefix the commit message with the branch name.
