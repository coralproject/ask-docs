These can be fairly large (~500MB per image), so it may take a few minutes.\n\n\n3. Once all Docker images have been downloaded, you\nll see something like the following in your terminal:\n\n\nCreating proxy_mongodata_1\nCreating proxy_sponge_1\nCreating proxy_rabbitmq_1\nCreating proxy_atollapp_1\nCreating proxy_xeniaapp_1\nCreating proxy_pillarapp_1\nCreating proxy_cayapp_1\nCreating proxy_proxy_1\n\n\n\n\n4.

The regular  CRUD  endpoint URL pattern is  /api/* , where as the URL pattern for import endpoints is  /api/import/* .    Import-related endpoints allow you to import data into Coral from an existing source system (i.e., an existing database of comment information).   Coral keeps track of the original identifiers (i.e., the user id), and stores that data (using a structure called  ImportSource ) in a field named  Source . That means you won t lose the original identifier data from your original source when you import into Coral.     All import endpoints  upsert  data. This means that when you import an entry, it will overwrite the information for that entry if the entry already exists. This prevents duplications and other problems.",

This external database is the source of your existing comment data that will be extracted by Sponge and sent to Pillar, which will then load it into the Coral ecosystem.\n\n\nThe external sources we currently support are: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs.\n\n\nVendoring dependencies\n\n\nYou should be vendoring the packages you choose to use (\nvendoring\n is the moving of all third party items such as packages into the \n/vendor\n directory). We recommend using \ngovendor\n. This tool will manage your dependencies from the vendor folder associated with this project repository.\n\n\nInstall from source\n\n\nBefore you begin\n\n\nIf you want to install from source, you will need to have Go installed.\n\n\nFirst \ninstall Go\n. The \ninstallation and setup instructions\n on the Go website are pretty good. Ensure that you have exported your $GOPATH environment variable, as detailed in the \ninstallation instructions\n.\n\n\nIf you are not on a version of Go that is 1.7 or higher, you will also have to set the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT flag.\n\n\nexport GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not on a version of Go 1.7 or higher, we recommend adding this to your ~/.bash_profile or other startup script.\n\n\nGet the source code\n\n\nYou can install the source code via using the \ngo get\n command, or by manually cloning the code.\n\n\nUsing the go get command\n\n\ngo get github.com/coralproject/sponge\n\n\n\n\nIf you see a message about \nno buildable Go source files\n like the below, you can ignore it. It simply means that there are buildable source files in subdirectories, just not the uppermost sponge directory.\n\n\npackage github.com/coralproject/sponge: no buildable Go source files in [directory]\n\n\n\n\nCloning manually\n\n\nYou can also clone the code manually.\n\n\nmkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge\n\ngit clone git@github.com:CoralProject/sponge.git\n\n\n\n\nSet up your strategy.json file\n\n\nYou can read about \nstrategy files in depth here\n.\n\n\nThe strategy.json file tells Sponge how to do the transformation between the publisher\ns existing data and the Coral data schema. It also tells us how to connect to the external publisher\ns source data. We currently support the following sources: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs.\n\n\nWe have example strategy.json files for each of those source types. You can see those example strategy.json files in the \nexamples\n folder: \n$GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/examples\n\n\nTo copy one of the example strategy.json files to another folder, where you can then customize it:\n\n\ncp $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/examples/strategy.json.example $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/strategy/strategy.json\n\n\n\n\nSet your environment variables\n\n\nSetting your environment variables tells Sponge which strategy file you want to use, and the URL for the \nPillar\n instance you are pushing data to.\n\n\nMake your own copy of the \nconfig/dev.cfg\n file (you can edit this configuration file with your own values, and then ensure that you don\nt commit it back to the repository). Call your config file whatever you like; we\nll call it \ncustom\n in this example.\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge\ncp config/dev.cfg config/custom.cfg\n\n\n\n\nNow edit the values in your custom.cfg file:\n\n\nexport STRATEGY_CONF=/path/to/my/strategy.json\nexport PILLAR_URL=http://localhost:8080\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSTRATEGY_CONF\n variable specifies the path to your strategy.json file.\n\n\nThe \nPILLAR_URL\n variable specifies the URL where your Pillar instance is running. If you installed Pillar locally from source, this will probably be \nhttp://localhost:8080\n.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\nve edited and saved your custom.cfg file, source it:\n\n\nsource $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/config/custom.cfg\n\n\n\n\nRun Sponge\n\n\nYou can either run Sponge using Go, or via a CLI tool.\n\n\nRunning Sponge using go run\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/sponge/cmd/sponge\ngo run main.go\n\n\n\n\nRunning Sponge using the CLI tool\n\n\nFirst build the CLI tool:\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/cmd/cmd/sponge\ngo build\n\n\n\n\nThen run the CLI tool\n\n\n./sponge -h\n\n\n\n\nInstall as a Docker container\n\n\nBuilding image\n\n\nTo build the docker image run this command:\n\n\ndocker build -t \nsponge:latest\n -f Dockerfile ./\n\n\n\n\nEdit env.list\n\n\nSetting your environment variables tells Sponge which strategy file you want to use, and the URL for the \nPillar\n instance you are pushing data to.\n\n\nPILLAR_URL=http://192.168.99.100:8080\nSTRATEGY_CONF=/strategy/strategy_psql.json\n\n# DATABASE\n# (optional if you want to overwrite strategy file values)\nDB_database= \n\nDB_username= \n\nDB_password= \n\nDB_host= \n\nDB_port= \n\n\n# WEB SERVICE\n# (optional if you want to overwrite strategy file values)\nWS_appkey= \n\nWS_endpoint= \n\nWS_records= \n\nWS_pagination= \n\nWS_useragent= \n\nWS_attributes= \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSTRATEGY_CONF\n variable specifies the path to your strategy.json file.\n\n\nThe \nPILLAR_URL\n variable specifies the URL where your Pillar instance is running.

The \ninstallation and setup instructions\n on the Go website are quite good. Ensure that you have exported your $GOPATH environment variable, as detailed in the \ninstallation instructions\n.\n\n\nIf you are not on a version of Go that is 1.7 or higher, you will also have to set the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT flag.\n\n\nexport GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not on a version of Go 1.7 or higher, we recommend adding this to your ~/.bash_profile or other startup script.\n\n\nObtaining the source code\n\n\nYou can install the source code via using the \ngo get\n command, or by manually cloning the code.\n\n\nUsing the go get command\n\n\ngo get github.com/coralproject/xenia\n\n\n\n\nIf you see a message about \nno buildable Go source files\n like the below, you can ignore it. It simply means that there are buildable source files in subdirectories, just not the uppermost xenia directory.\n\n\npackage github.com/coralproject/xenia: no buildable Go source files in [directory]\n\n\n\n\nCloning manually\n\n\nYou can also clone the code manually.\n\n\nmkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia\n\ngit clone git@github.com:CoralProject/xenia.git\n\n\n\n\nSet up your environment variables\n\n\nThis tells Xenia which database you want to use, sets your port, and sets your database password.\n\n\nMake your own copy of the \nconfig/dev.cfg\n file (this edited cfg file will contain your own values for things like your database password, and will not be committed back to the repository if you are doing development work on Xenia). Call your config file whatever you like; we\nll call it \ncustom\n in this example.\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia\ncp config/dev.cfg config/custom.cfg\n\n\n\n\nEdit the environment variables to reflect your MongoDB setup.\n\nRemember, you\nre entering your password here, so be sure not to commit this file to the repository!\n\n\nexport XENIA_MONGO_HOST=localhost:27017\nexport XENIA_MONGO_USER=coral-user\nexport XENIA_MONGO_AUTHDB=coral\nexport XENIA_MONGO_DB=coral\n\nexport XENIA_LOGGING_LEVEL=1\nexport XENIA_HOST=:4000\n\n# Use to have the CLI tooling hit the web service.\nexport XENIA_WEB_HOST=\nexport XENIA_WEB_AUTH=\n\n# Set host to Anvil if configured.\n# export XENIA_ANVIL_HOST=https://HOST\n\n# Use to apply extra key:value pairs to the header\n# export XENIA_HEADERS=key:value,key:value\n\n# DO NOT PUSH TO REPO\nexport XENIA_MONGO_PASS=\n\n\n\n\nRequired edits:\n\n\n\n\nXENIA_MONGO_HOST\n: set to your MongoDB where you will be communicating with.\n\n\nIf you are running MongoDB locally on your machine, you should set this to \nlocalhost:27017\n.\n\n\nIf you are pointing to a MongoDB running on a server somewhere, set this to the IP address and port of your MongoDB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXENIA_MONGO_DB\n: the database you are running queries against (\ncoral\n).\n\n\nXENIA_MONGO_USER\n: your MongoDB username.\n\n\nXENIA_MONGO_PASS\n: the password for your MongoDB user.\n\n\nXENIA_MONGO_AUTHDB\n: the database you are authenticating against (in most cases, should be the same \ncoral\n database as XENIA_MONGO_DB).\n\n\n\n\nOptional edits:\n\n\n\n\nXENIA_WEB_HOST\n: this is required for the CLI tool. It is the address of the Xenia web service (i.e., an instance of Xenia that you are running on a server).\n\n\nIf you are running everything locally, comment this variable out. This means that the CLI tool will connect directly to your local database, instead of connecting to a running web service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXENIA_HOST\n: default is \n:4000\n if this variable is not set.\n\n\nXENIA_LOGGING_LEVEL\n: default is \n2\n if this variable is not set.\n\n\nXENIA_WEB_AUTH\n: your Anvil token, if you have Anvil authentication set up. If you do not have authentication set up, leave this commented out.\n\n\nXENIA_ANVIL_HOST\n: the URL to the Anvil host, if you have Anvil authentication set up. If you do not have authentication set up, leave this commented out.\n\n\nXENIA_HEADERS\n: leave this commented out.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\nve finished editing, source your config file using the source command:\n\n\nsource $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia/config/custom.cfg\n\n\n\n\nBuild the CLI tool\n\n\nXenia has a CLI tool that allows you to manage endpoints and perform other actions.\n\n\nTo build to the tool:\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia/cmd/xenia\ngo build\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is best to run with logging level 0 when using the xenia command:\n\n\nexport XENIA_LOGGING_LEVEL=0\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Xenia database for the first time\n\n\nIf you are running Xenia on a MongoDB database for the first time you will need the Xenia command line tool to set up the MongoDB for use with Xenia. The CLI tool will create collections and sets of indexes that you can use to execute queries: a sort of dictionary of pre-made queries for you to use.\n\n\n1) First cd into cmd/xenia directory (this contains the CLI tool):\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia/cmd/xenia\n\n\n\n\n2) Configure the database using \ndb create\n. The database.json file contains the information necessary to create the collections and indexes.\n\n\n./xenia db create -f scrdb/database.json\n\n\n\n\nExpected output:\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nCreating collection query_sets\nCreating collection query_sets_history\nCreating collection query_scripts\nCreating collection query_scripts_history\nCreating collection query_masks\nCreating collection query_masks_history\nCreating collection query_regexs\nCreating collection query_regexs_history\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting note #1\n\n\nIf you get a response that contains \nERROR: Invalid DB provided\n, you may have an incorrectly set environment variable. If you are running everything locally and using a local MongoDB, use \nprintev\n to see if \nXENIA_WEB_HOST\n is set:\n\n\nprintenv XENIA_WEB_HOST\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a local MongoDB, this should not return a value. If it does return a value, unset the variable using \nunset\n, and then try step 2 again:\n\n\nunset XENIA_WEB_HOST\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting note #2\n\n\nInstead of the expected output shown above, you may see something like:\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nCreating collection query_sets\nERROR: collection already exists\n\n\n\n\nThat\ns okay! It means that your database is already set up with Xenia. Perhaps you imported data that already had configured collections set up. Continue on to step 3.\n\n\n3) Load all the existing queries:\n\n\n./xenia query upsert -p scrquery\n\n\n\n\nExpected output:\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nUpserting Set : Path[scrquery]\nUpserting Set : Upserted\n\n\n\n\n4) Load all the existing masks:\n\n\n./xenia mask upsert -p scrmask\n\n\n\n\nExpected output:\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nUpserting Set : Path[scrquery]\nUpserting Set : Upserted\n\n\n\n\n5) Load all the existing regexes:\n\n\n./xenia regex upsert -p scrregex\n\n\n\n\nExpected output:\n\n\nConfiguring MongoDB\nUpserting Regex : Path[scrregex]\nUpserting Regex : Upserted\n\n\n\n\n6) That\ns it! If you are using MongoChef, you should be able to see your newly created collections, which will look something like this:\n\n\n\n\nRun the web service\n\n\n1) First cd into the directory containing the web service, xeniad (the Xenia daemon):\n\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coralproject/xenia/cmd/xeniad\n\n\n\n\n2) Build the Xenia web service:\n\n\ngo build\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the web service:\n\n\n./xeniad\n\n\n\n\nExpected output:\n\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 app.go:173: USER : startup : Init :\n\nConfig Settings:\nMONGO_USER=coral-user\nMONGO_AUTHDB=coral\nMONGO_DB=coral\nHOST=:4000\nLOGGING_LEVEL=1\nMONGO_HOST=localhost:27017\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:24: USER : startup : Init : Revision     : \nunknown\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:25: USER : startup : Init : Version      : \nunknown\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:26: USER : startup : Init : Build Date   : \nunknown\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:27: USER : startup : Init : Int Version  : \n201606081030\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:28: USER : startup : Init : Go Version   : \ngo1.6.2\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:29: USER : startup : Init : Go Compiler  : \ngc\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:30: USER : startup : Init : Go ARCH      : \namd64\n\n2016/06/08 10:26:38 main.go:31: USER : startup : Init : Go OS        : \ndarwin\n\n\n\n\n\n4) You can test your web service by going to the following URL in your browser: \nhttp://localhost:4000/1.0/query\n.\n\n\nIn your browser, you will see some json displayed.

Here is a multi query set with variable substitution and date processing:  GET\nhttp://localhost:4000/1.0/exec/basic?station_id=42021\n\n{\n    name : basic ,\n    desc : Shows a basic multi result query. ,\n    enabled :true,\n    queries :[\n      {\n          name : Basic ,\n          type : pipeline ,\n          collection : test_bill ,\n          return :true,\n          scripts :[\n            { $match : { station_id  :  #station_id# }},\n            { $project : { _id : 0,  name : 1}}\n         ]\n      },\n      {\n          name : Time ,\n          type : pipeline ,\n          collection : test_bill ,\n          return :true,\n          scripts :[\n            { $match : { condition.date  : { $gt :  #date:2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z }}},\n            { $project : { _id : 0,  name : 1}},\n            { $limit : 2}\n         ]\n      }\n   ]\n}  Here is the list of commands that exist for variable substitution.  { field :  #cmd:variable }\n\n// Basic commands.\nBefore: { field :  #number:variable_name }      After: { field : 1234}\nBefore: { field :  #string:variable_name }      After: { field :  value }\nBefore: { field :  #date:variable_name }        After: { field : time.Time}\nBefore: { field :  #objid:variable_name }       After: { field : mgo.ObjectId}\nBefore: { field :  #regex:/pattern/{options} }  After: { field : bson.RegEx}\n\n// data command can index into saved results.\nBefore: { field  : { $in :  #data.*:list.station_id }}}   After: [{ station_id : 42021 }]\nBefore: { field :  #data.0:doc.station_id }               After: { field :  23453 }\n\n// time command manipulates the current time.\nBefore: { field : #time:0}                 After: { field : time.Time(Current Time)}\nBefore: { field : #time:-3600}             After: { field : time.Time(3600 seconds in the past)}\nBefore: { field : #time:3m}                After: { field : time.Time(3 minutes in the future)}\n\nPossible duration types. Default is seconds if not provided. ns : Nanosecond us : Microsecond ms : Millisecond s  : Second m  : Minute h  : Hour  You can save the result of one query for later use by the next.

The second query is using the  #data  command. The data command has two options. Use can use  #data.*  or  #data.Idx .  Use the  *  operator when you need an array. In this example we need to support an  $in  command:  {\n    name : retrieve_stations ,\n    desc :  Retrieve the list of stations ,\n    type : pipeline ,\n    collection : test_xenia_data ,\n    return :true,\n    commands :[\n      { $match : { station_id  : { $in :  #data.*:list.station_id }}},\n      { $project : { _id : 0,  name : 1}},\n   ]\n}\n\nWhen you need an array to be substituted.\nBefore: { field  : { $in :  #data.*:list.station_id }}}\nAfter : { field  : { $in : [ 42021 ]}}\n    dataOp :  * \n    lookup :  list.station_id \n    results: { list : [{ station_id : 42021 }]}  Use the index operator when you need a single value. Specify which document in the array of documents you want to select:  \n{\n    name : retrieve_stations ,\n    desc :  Retrieve the list of stations ,\n    type : pipeline ,\n    collection : test_xenia_data ,\n    return :true,\n    commands :[\n      { $match : { station_id  :  #data.0:list.station_id }},\n      { $project : { _id : 0,  name : 1}},\n   ]\n}\n\nWhen you need a single value to be substituted, select an index.\nBefore: { field  :  #data.0:list.station_id }\nAfter : { field  :  42021 }\n    dataOp : 0\n    lookup :  list.station_id \n    results: { list : [{ station_id : 42021 }, { station_id : 23567 }]}  You can also replace field names in the query commands.

This guide will take you step by step through the process of getting the documentation on to your local machine, editing the documentation, and submitting your changes. If you\nve never worked with Git before, it might seem a little intimidating, but we\nve broken it down for you into manageable chunks.\n\n\nBriefly, the process is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you will get the documentation source code, using Git.\n\n\nThen, you will work on the documentation. You will use Mkdocs and Markdown to write the documentation.\n\n\nThen, you will push your changes to GitHub.\n\n\nFinally, you will deploy the documentation. This is done using a simple Mkdocs commands that builds the documentation and deploys it to GitHub pages.\n\n\n\n\nInstall and set up Git\n\n\nIf you don\nt already have Git installed, you\nll want to get that set up first. You\nll have to \ndownload and install Git\n. You can read more about Git on \ntheir website\n.\n\n\nYou will also have to \ncreate a GitHub account\n, which is a very straightforward process.\n\n\nAfter installing Git, the first thing you should do is setup your name and email using the following commands:\n\n\ngit config --global user.name \nYour Real Name\n\ngit config --global user.email \nyou@email.com\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that user.name should be your real name, not your GitHub username. The email you use in the user.email field will be used to associate your commits with your GitHub account.\n\n\nInstall MkDocs\n\n\nThe Coral Project\ns documentation uses the \nMkDocs\n documentation system, which uses \nMarkdown\n to format text. Before you can get started on writing and editing the documentation, you will need to have MkDocs installed.\n\n\nYou can \ndownload and install MkDocs\n using the instructions on their website. The \nMkDocs website\n also contains a lot of good information on writing documentation in MkDocs, and there are plenty of decent Markdown cheatsheets floating around, \nlike this one\n.\n\n\nGetting the documentation\n\n\nAll of the documentation for the Coral Project \nresides in GitHub\n in the \ndocs\n repository.\n\n\nTo get a local version of the documentation, clone the repository using this command:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/coralproject/docs.git\n\n\n\n\nYou now have a local copy of the documentation on your local machine, that you can modify and add to.\n\n\nNote\n: If you already have a local copy of the documentation repository on your computer, be sure to perform a \ngit pull\n before you start editing. This will ensure that you are working on the most recent available version of the documentation, which will prevent potential merge conflicts when you\nre ready to commit your changes.\n\n\nWriting and editing the documentation\n\n\nAs you are writing the documentation, refer to the \nDocumentation Style Guide\n to make sure you are remaining consistent with our current documentation standards, and writing the best and clearest documentation possible.\n\n\nCommit your changes\n\n\nOnce you\nve finished your edits, it\ns time to commit your changes back up to the remote repository on GitHub.\n\n\nFirst, you\nll add your changes, where \nfilename\n is the name of the file or files that you have changed.\n\n\ngit add \nfilename\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you\nll commit your changes. Be sure to add a commit message (the portion within the single quotations) to let everyone know what it is that you\nve changed. The \n-m\n flag is what tells Git that you\nre adding a commit message.\n\n\ngit commit -m 'Updated the Ask tutorial'\n\n\n\n\nFinally, push your changes up to the remote repository:\n\n\ngit push origin master\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the documentation\n\n\nNow that the documentation has been updated and committed to the repository, you can deploy the documentation. The documentation is hosted on Heroku, so in order to deploy it, we need to first build the files that make up the site, and then push those files up to Heroku.\n\n\nFirst ensure that you have the latest version of the documentation on your local machine:\n\n\ngit pull\n\n\n\n\nThen, run the following command:\n\n\nmkdocs build --clean\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbuild\n command builds the documentation, creating the HTML pages that make up the site, and places those files in the \nsite\n directory.\n\n\nNow you\nll add the changed files using Git, in preparation for pushing them to Heroku to deploy them. Add a meaningful commit message.\n\n\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \nUpdated writing documentation page\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you\nll push the \nsite\n directory, containing the pages that make up the website, to Heroku.\n\n\ngit subtree push --prefix site heroku master\n\n\n\n\nTranslating documentation\n\n\nTo come.",

Do not assume knowledge!\n\n\nWriting style\n\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt about a grammatical or syntactical point, refer to the \nAssociated Press\ns (AP) Style Guide\n.\n\n\nThough we value good style, please don\u2019t get too hung up on using correct style. We\u2019d rather have you submit good information that doesn\u2019t conform to the guide than no information at all.\n\n\nIn general, try to write simple, declarative prose. We prefer short, single-clause sentences and brief three-to-five sentence paragraphs. Try to choose vocabulary that is straightforward and precise.\n\n\nPronouns\n:\n\n\nUse gender-neutral pronouns (they/their/them) rather than \nhe or she\n.\n\n\nFirst and second person pronouns are fine. Always use \u201cwe\u201d to refer to Coral and \u201cyou\u201d to refer to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid excessive use of \ni.e.\n.\n\n\nSection headers and page headers should follow sentence case formatting (first word capitalized, following words uncapitalized) rather than title case (each word in the header capitalized).\n\n\nWhenever possible, include a section at the beginning of the page that describes what is contained within that page (with hyperlinks to the relevant sections). Sure, usually this will also appear on the Table of Contents in the side navigation section, but it\ns also useful to have it displayed within the text itself.\n\n\n\n\nDo not assume knowledge\n\n\n\n\nDon\nt be afraid to explain something that might seem very basic or self-explanatory to you; it may not be so basic to someone else.\n\n\nWhenever possible, include an actual, specific instruction and (if required) command.\n\n\nBad: \nClone the repository to your machine.\n\n\nGood: \nClone the docs repository to your local machine, using the command \ngit clone https://github.com/coralproject/docs.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are command line instructions involved, include the precise command line instruction. Instructions that users can copy/paste into the command line are great!\n\n\nShow \nexpected results\n wherever possible. If a command line instruction should return a certain result, show that expected result. If there is a URL you can visit to test whether or not something is working, provide that URL as a link.\n\n\nIf there are variables to configure, explicitly state the purpose of the variables. This should be explained in a comment in the configuration file, but you should also provide an explanation in your instructions.\n\n\nDo not merely explain HOW to do something, but also, whenever possible, WHY you are doing it in that way. This makes it easier for users to troubleshoot issues.\n\n\n\n\nThird-party components\n\n\nIs there a third-party component the user needs to set up (for instance, MongoDB)?\n\n\n\n\nYou don\nt have to include all setup instructions, but do link to the setup instructions on the website of the third-party app in question (hopefully the third-party app is well-documented; if not, you may have to fill in the gaps).\n\n\nBe sure to detail any specific instructions they will need to integrate this third-party component into the system.\n\n\nCurrently, much of this \nthird party setup\n information resides in the \nDeveloper Setup\n document. This reduces duplication if there is a component that needs to be set up for multiple items.\n\n\n\n\nWriting installation instructions\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to include \nevery single step\n.\n\n\nInclude screenshots when it makes sense to do so.\n\n\nIf there are command line instructions, include the exact instruction in a code block so that users can copy/paste.\n\n\n\n\nWriting API documentation\n\n\nWhen documenting a REST-style API, such as the \nPillar API\n, there are certain pieces of information to include. The \nPillar API documentation\n is a useful template.\n\n\n\n\nCreate an initial table that lists endpoints, which contains:\n\n\nThe endpoint URL.\n\n\nThe HTTP verb for that endpoint (GET, POST).\n\n\nThe basic functionality description for that endpoint. Make this into a targeted link that jumps to the full description for that endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a full description for each endpoint. You can see the \nGet Users\n Pillar endpoint for an example). Each description should include:\n\n\nThe parameters for the endpoint (include the parameter name, whether it is required or optional, the type, and the description).\n\n\nAn example call.\n\n\nThe response for the example call (whether that is a JSON object, or simply a status response).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Guide documentation\n\n\nWhen documenting \nUser Guides\n, it is important to remember that the people reading them may not have in-depth technical knowledge. Keep your audience in mind.\n\n\nWriting User Guide tutorials\n\n\n\n\nTutorials take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to create or achieve something.\n\n\nTutorials should be \nresults oriented\n: by the end of the tutorial, the user will have achieved something.\n\n\nThe important thing in a tutorial is to help the reader achieve something useful, preferably as early as possible, in order to give them confidence.\n\n\nExplain the nature of the problem we\u2019re solving, so that the reader understands what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Don\u2019t feel that you need to begin with explanations of how things work - what matters is what the reader does, not what you explain. It can be helpful to refer back to what you\u2019ve done and explain afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n\n\nThe tutorials for each product are all contained on a single page. View the \nTrust tutorial page\n for an example.\n\n\nAt the top of the tutorial page is a list of the tutorials available on that page. Each has a description in the form of a user story (i.e., \nI would like to\n).\n\n\nA tutorial is not a general overview of the functionality of the product, but a specific how-to that fulfills a user story. The general overview of the product\ns functionality belows on the Overview page for that product.\n\n\nThe goal of a tutorial is to walk the user through a scenario (such as \nidentify trolls within the Business section\n), that they can then tailor to their own needs (\nidentify trolls within the Health section\n).\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\n\n\nTutorials follow a numbered step-by-step format.\n\n\nYou do not have to use the Markdown \nnumbered list\n formatting (in which the numbered list is written \n1.\n for auto-formatting). In fact, it is probably better if you don\nt: things get a bit wonky when you start inserting images in between the numbered steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\n\n\nEach step (or very nearly each step) should have an image illustrating that step, and potentially showing the location of a button or field. If you do not have an image illustrating that step, you should have a pretty good reason not to have it.\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\n\n\nGit is capitalized.\n\n\nGitHub capitalizes both the G and the H.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly used terms:\n\n\nSoftware specific\n\n\n\n\nCoral\n: Refers to the Coral product, which includes the three components Trust, Ask, and Talk.\n\n\nCoral Project\n: Refers to the project of building and crafting the Coral product.\n\n\nCoral Ecosystem\n: Refers to all of the pieces that make up Coral from a more technical or development perspective: includes all the technical components such as Pillar, Sponge, and Cay.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n: Refers to the technical users of Coral who will be installing Coral and working with the backend. Also refers to open-source contributors.\n\n\nEnd Users\n: Refers to anyone who will be interacting with the Coral front end. Examples of end users are publishers, moderators, journalists, and readers.\n\n\n\n\nMarkup specific style\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\nWhen you need to add a graphic, try to make the file-size as small as possible. If you need help reducing file-size of a high-resolution image, feel free to contact us for help. Usually, graphics should go in the same directory as the .md file that references them, or in a subdirectory for images if one already exists.\n\n\nThe preferred file format for graphics is PNG, but GIF and JPG are also acceptable.\n\n\nIf you are referring to a specific part of the UI in an image, use call-outs (circles and arrows or lines) to highlight what you\u2019re referring to. Line width for call-outs should not exceed five pixels. The preferred color for call-outs is red.\n\n\nBe sure to include descriptive alt-text for the graphic. This greatly helps users with accessibility issues.\n\n\n\n\nThe color used for highlighting rectangles and arrows is Hex Color #00C7FC. This offers a good contrast with the Coral theme colors.\n\n\nWhen taking screenshots to use as illustrative images, include a decent amount of \nsurrounding area\n to provide context and geography for the feature you\nre discussing. A screenshot of a button, for instance, isn\nt very useful when you can\nt figure out where the button is located.\n\n\n\n\nCommands and code blocks\n\n\n\n\nEnclose commands and code blocks in triple-tick blocks (```). Yes, Markdown supports indentation to delineate code blocks, but the triple-ticks make things more explicit.\n\n\nBe sure you are using universal command line commands, not shortcuts available in some shells.\n\n\nGood: \nmkdir exampledirectory\n\n\nBad: \nmd exampledirectory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\n\n\n\nWhen adding headlines and section dividers, keep in mind that the Table of Contents displayed in the side navigation bar to the left is only two levels deep. So, H1 (#) and H2 (##) text will show up in the Table of Contents. H3 (###) and below will not.\n\n\nTo avoid making the Table of Contents too cluttered, try to only use H2 (##) for key large sections.",

This helps to avoid common errors, improves code readability, and ensures that your PRs have a better chance of getting accepted and merged.\n\n\nThe coding style guide consists of the following sections:\n\n\n\n\nCore code principles\n\n\nWorking with repositories (naming, describing, etc.)\n\n\nWorking with Git (creating good commit messages)\n\n\nGo coding style\n\n\nNode.js / Javascript coding style\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\n\n\n\nCore code principles\n\n\nThese are the four basic principles that guide how we shape and build our code. All Coral Project software is conceived from the ground up to be:\n\n\n\n\nConfigurable\n: We strive to use configuration to deliver as much business logic, data modeling, and other aspects of our systems as \nis practical.\n Doing so gives us the ability to quickly configure precise UI experiences, data structures, and data science analysis with minimal need for coding, upgrades, server work, etc. Ultimately, we want the community managers who run our software to feel like they are designing their own house. This means trying things to see how they feel, looking at the results, and quickly making changes based on what they learn. We take our inspiration from the ever-changing, adaptable ecosystems of coral reefs.\n\n\nModular\n: Coral products can be used together to form a fully functioning community platform, or be used in pieces to complement existing software. In order to accomplish this, we are building core API features, message passing and import/export strategies in everything we do. We are also refining, documenting, and publishing deployment strategies for each of our products both in isolation as well as together as groups of our products configured to work in concert.\n\n\nPrivacy Minded\n: There is an implicit act of trust involved in registration for and engagement in an online community. Maintaining that trust is a top priority for us. Privacy for us begins with security concerns, and stretches deep into our product thinking. Whenever information is entered into our systems, we want to make it clear who will be able to see that information and how it will be used. We want to build safe, comfortable places that allow for conversations of varying levels of exposure, without false expectations or nasty surprises.\n\n\nSecure, Stable and Scalable\n: Our deployment recommendations, if followed, provide usable and secure environments. Each piece of our software has internal checks to catch any error states and trigger alarms, as well as external restart mechanisms. All of our platforms have proven records for stability and well-known upgrade paths. We will publish auto-scaling deployment workflows where appropriate for large sites with varying loads.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with repositories\n\n\nRepository naming\n\n\nAs you may have guessed, each component of Coral is named after a different type of coral. We like to match up some traits of the particular type of coral with the functionality of the component, but that\ns not always possible.\n\n\nChoose a variety of coral to name your repo. Make sure that there isn\nt already a repo named something similar.\n\n\nRepository descriptions\n\n\nThe description of a repo tells the public what is contained in the repo itself. If you have multiple repositories for the same project, it\ns better to describe what is contained in the repo itself instead of describing the project.\n\n\nRepo descriptions should be clear, concise, and descriptive. Descriptions are listed under each repository title on an organization\u2019s GitHub page. Anyone who scans the GitHub page should be able to determine what a repo does, just by looking at the description.\n\n\nIf your repo is not in active development, it\u2019s helpful to let users know this so they don\u2019t make contributions to a non-active repository. We suggest adding the word DEPRECATED before your repo description.\n\n\nGo coding style\n\n\nFor our Go code, we follow all coding guidelines laid out by the Go community, as detailed in their \nEffective Go\n guide. This helps us to maintain a consistent code base. We also use the \nGo Code Review Comments\n as a guide.\n\n\nAlthough not all of our code may comply 100% with the \nEffective Go\n guidelines, we\nre not looking for an overhaul of our code to make everything comply. Rather, all new contributions should comply with the guidelines. The ultimate goal is to make the code base easier for humans to navigate and understand.\n\n\nA few specific rules we follow\n\n\n\n\nAll code should be formatted with \ngofmt -s\n. (Read more about \ngofmt here\n.)\n\n\nAll code should pass the default levels of\n   \ngolint\n.\n\n\nComment the code. Tell us the why, the history and the context.\n\n\nDocument \nall\n declarations and methods, even private ones. Declare expectations, caveats and anything else that may be important. If a type gets exported, having the comments already there will ensure it\ns ready.\n\n\nThe length of a variable names should be proportional to its context, and preferably relatively short. In practice, short methods will have short variable names and globals will have longer names.\n\n\nBad: \nnoCommaALongVariableNameLikeThisIsNotMoreClearWhenASimpleCommentWouldDo\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo underscores in package names. If you need a compound name, step back, and re-examine why you need a compound name. If you still think you need a compound name, lose the underscore.\n\n\nNo utils or helper packages. If a function is not general enough to warrant its own package, it has not been written generally enough to be a part of a util package. Just leave it unexported and well-documented.\n\n\nAll tests should run with \ngo test\n and outside tooling should not be required. No, we don\nt need another unit testing framework. Assertion packages are acceptable if they provide \nreal\n incremental value.\n\n\nEven though we call these \nrules\n above, they are actually just guidelines.

You can read more about it on \nour website\n.\n\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n\nWe\u2019re creating open-source software to facilitate the importing, storage, moderation, and display of contributions to news websites. That includes images, video, and text such as comments, annotations, and blog posts.\n\n\nWho\u2019s behind the project?\n\n\nIt\u2019s led by a team from Mozilla, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. It\u2019s funded by a two-year grant by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The ideas guiding it are coming from readers, contributors, journalists, community managers, researchers, and developers. \nAnd you, if the mood strikes you\n.\n\n\nThis is that comment system that Mozilla is building for the Times and the Post, right?\n\n\nNot exactly. All three organizations are working together, and we\u2019re focusing on many kinds of text contributions, as well as images and video. We\u2019ll be creating software that publishers \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 can use to better connect with their community. And that contributors can use to better connect with publishers.\n\n\nWhat about digital community do you want to improve?\n\n\nWe want to give publishers the ability to better understand their contributors and control the level of discourse on their sites; empower contributors to manage their identities and data; and provide readers with a more productive discussion about current events.\n\n\nDevelopment process\n\n\nSo you\u2019ll release your software in two years?\n\n\nNo, we\u2019ll be creating software throughout our grant period and working with contributors, publishers, academics, and readers to iterate on it.\n\n\nHow long has the project been going?\n\n\nWe had a research phase in early 2014, our grant was approved in June 2014, and we\u2019ve been planning and building our team in the time since.\n\n\nHow will the software work?\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be building a flexible core system and a series of plugins, all connected through APIs. Publishers \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 can choose to use everything we deploy or pick and choose plugins that fit specific needs.\n\n\nWill it work on mobile?\n\n\nWe\u2019re developing for all browsers and devices.\n\n\nIs this for me?\n\n\nI\u2019m a regular commenter on news sites. What\u2019s in it for me?\n\n\nWe want to give you tools to own and manage your identity and contributions across websites and analytics that allow you to understand who\u2019s interacting with the content you create.\n\n\nI work at a news site that\u2019s smaller than The Post and The Times. Will this work for us?\n\n\nOur aim is to make the software we create easy to manage for publishers large and small. If you\u2019ve got specific needs you\u2019d like to talk about, please [email link]get in touch with us[/email link].\n\n\nHow can I keep up with what you\u2019re doing?\n\n\nWatch this website. We\u2019ll be posting updates regularly once our development begins in earnest.\n\n\nI\u2019ve got a few ideas to share with you. How can I get in touch?\n\n\nPlease get in touch with us here\n. We\u2019re eager to hear from you.\n\n\nData sources\n\n\nWhich external data sources are supported?\n\n\nWe currently support mySQL, PostgreSQL, MondoDB, and REST APIs.\n\n\nWe use Elasticsearch. Can we connect to that?\n\n\nNot yet. Our currently supported external data sources are mySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs. However, you can write your own driver to connect to Elasticsearch. The drivers are part of the \nSponge\n app, and you can find out more about the driver components \nhere\n.\n\n\nHow often does the data refresh in the Trust app?\n\n\nThe data in the Trust app refreshes every 24 hours.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nHow would we get started?\n\n\nYou can learn more about the different installation options on our \ndeveloper overview page\n. The quickest and easiest way to get started is probably the \nAll-in-One Docker installation\n, but you can read about each available option (and whether it is likely to be the best option for you) on the \ndeveloper overview page\n.\n\n\nDo you have dummy data that we can use?\n\n\nYes. Our dummy data consists of thoroughly scrubbed and anonymized comments data from the Washington Post commenting database.\n\n\nIf you install Coral through the \nAll-in-One Docker installation\n, you should automatically have the dummy data set up for you in your MongoDB.\n\n\nIf you want to manually import sample data (for example, if you\nve installed Coral from source code), you can read more about how to do that \non the developer setup page\n.",
